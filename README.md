# GSuite-to-PDF
Simple Bookmarklet to export PDF of Doc

Based on a Tweet from GSuite (https://twitter.com/gsuite/status/1076613401021952000),
I thought I'd make something that was Actually user-friendly.

So I made a bookmarklet for it :D

-----------------------------------------

How to use this.

In your browser, add a new Bookmark.
1) Highlight & Copy the little JS string
2) In the Name/Label field, put something sensible (such as: GSuite Doc 2 PDF)
3) In the URL field, paste the JS string you copied
4) Save
5) On any GDoc page, click your bookmark,
   and it should make the browser download that doc as a PDF
